### Basic Functionalities:

1. **Connect to Messaging Queue**:
   - Establish connections to one or more messaging queues.
   - Support for popular messaging protocols such as AMQP, Kafka, etc.

2. **Consume Messages**:
   - Listen for incoming messages from the subscribed queue(s).
   - Handle message consumption in a concurrent and efficient manner.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Process incoming messages, which may include decoding, transformation, or enrichment based on business logic.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle failures gracefully.
   - Retry failed message processing or handle errors according to defined policies.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Logging of important events, errors, and informational messages.
   - Support for monitoring and metrics collection to track system health and performance.

6. **Data Persistence**:
   - Write processed data to a downstream datastore (e.g., database, cache, file system, messaging queues).
   - Ensure data integrity and reliability during the persistence process.

7. **Routing and Filtering**:
   - Implement routing and filtering mechanisms to selectively route messages to different downstream destinations.
   - Support for message filtering based on content, metadata, or other criteria.

8. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Efficiently handle concurrent message processing using goroutines and channels.
   - Manage concurrency to prevent resource contention and optimize performance.

9. **Configuration**:
   - Support for flexible configuration options, including queue connection settings, data storage configuration, and processing parameters.
   - Allow configuration through environment variables, configuration files, or command-line flags.

10. **Graceful Shutdown**:
    - Enable graceful shutdown procedures to ensure clean termination of the application.
    - Properly handle in-flight messages and ensure data integrity during shutdown.

### Running the code

Execute the following steps to run the code:

1. `cd` to the root directory.
2. Update the `config/` directory in `internal/` directory with the right configurations for your application.
3. Run `go build .`
4. Run `go run main.go -upstreamApp=valueX -downstreamApp=valueY` and replace `valueX` and `valueY` with the appropriate values.
